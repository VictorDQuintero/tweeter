# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone. It uses jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 to help web development students, like me, get better front-end skills.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

## Getting Started

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
4. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
5. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

## Functioning

As of now the project has the capability of creating posts and they will be displayed as the posts of random users.

Tweets may not be empty or longer than 140 characters.
